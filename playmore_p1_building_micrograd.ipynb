There's deliberately almost no code encapsulation and [DRY principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) is blatantly violated.

        "1. _Neural nets_ are mathematical expressions. They take _vectors of input data_ `x`, feed them forward through a _computational graph_ and into a non-linear function like `tanh` to compute the _loss function_. The _loss function_ measures accuracy of network predictions. Its value will be low when your network behaves well.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. A _neuron_ is a node of the _computational graph_. It has its _weights_ and a _bias_ that determine how inputs are transformed.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. A neural network is trained by iteratively computing _gradients_ of each node during the _backward pass_ to figure out how that impacts _loss_ of the entire network. These gradients are used to tweak the individual _weights_ and _biases_ in order to minimize the _loss function_. This optimization algorithm is called _gradient descent_.\n",
        "\n",
        "We built a very small network with just `41` parameters. But you can build much larger networks with _billions_ of parameters. As the size of the network and training data goes up, neural networks start to show fascinating emergent properties and capacity to solve complex problems.\n",
