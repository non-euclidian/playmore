# Playmore

This is **Playmore: Executable Transcript of Andrej Karpathy’s _“[Neural Networks: Zero to Hero](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ)”_ Series**. It's a hands-on, code-along lecture companion, complete with timecodes.

It shows _how_ the code in [Andrej's lectures](https://karpathy.ai/zero-to-hero.html) evolves, one idea at a time, following the linear order of the corresponding lecture. There's deliberately almost no code encapsulation and [DRY principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) is blatantly violated. This trade-off escapes the need to scroll up and down: all the relevant code is always in your sight.

## But why?

I started making these transcripts as a way to understand and review the material later. Then I realized this could be useful to others:
   
1. There's value in being able to follow the development of an idea through intuitions, trials and errors. It's a way of remembering the _why_ of how something works. Neat final code doesn't do that. These notebooks guide you through Andrej's intuitions that gradually lead to code.
2. I find that reading commentary and executing code is way more efficient to revisit ideas after a while than going through the video again.
3. Some people like text more than video. Or want to supplement one with the other for a multimodal learning experience.


If you want the final code and exercises, Andrej published them in [this Github repo](https://github.com/karpathy/nn-zero-to-hero/tree/master).

## Does this map 1:1 to the video?

Not word-by-word. Occasionally there's some extra code or metaphor I added to illustrate a point. Some parts are summarized and you should refer to the video for details. 

## How to take the most out of this?

> **_What I cannot create, I do not understand._**
>
> [Richard Feynman](https://journals.biologists.com/jcs/article/130/18/2941/56386/What-I-cannot-create-I-do-not-understand)

This project is a _play-as-you-watch_ lecture supplement helping you grasp material more fully and revise it after a while.

For maximum benefit, try to recreate the code for key ideas and write lecture notes of your own, aiming to express the underlying ideas precisely and poking holes in your reasoning.

## Why _Playmore_?

It's a reference to the _play_ button used for executing a `Jupyter` notebook cell. And a subtle invitation to learn by doing and playing, which is the most effective approach to master a subject. You don't learn to play tennis just by watching someone else do it - _gotta do it yourself!_
